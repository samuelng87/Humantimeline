<p>Earth is 4.5 billion years old. In just a fraction of that time, 
  one species among countless others has conquered it: which is us.</p>

  <p>ABOUT 13.5 BILLION YEARS AGO, MATTER, energy, time and space came into being in what is known as the Big Bang. The story of these fundamental features of our universe is called <b>"Physics"</b>. </p> 


  <p>About 300,000 years after their appearance, matter and energy started to coalesce into complex structures, called atoms, which then combined into molecules. 
        
    The story of atoms, molecules and their interactions is called <b>Chemistry</b>."</p>
    
    <p>About 3.8 billion years ago, on a planet called Earth, certain molecules combined to form particularly large and intricate structures called organisms. 
    
      The story of organisms is called <b>"Biology"</b>.</p>
    
<p>About 70,000 years ago, organisms belonging to the species Homo sapiensstarted to form even more elaborate structures called cultures. 
    
    The subsequent development of these human cultures is called <b>"History"</b>.</p>

    
   <p> <b>Three</b> important revolutions shaped the course of history: </p>
    
  <p> <b>The Cognitive Revolution </b> kick-started history about <b>70,000</b> years ago. </p>
    
   <p> <b>The Agricultural Revolution</b> sped it up about <b>12,000</b> years ago. </p>
    
   <p> <b style="color:red;">The Scientific Revolution</b>, which got under way only <b style="color: red;">500 years ago</b>, may well end history and start something completely different. </p>
    
   <p>  This website tells the list of timeline three revolutions in specific what has happen in between those era. </p>
